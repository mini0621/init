# Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:
# (a) Identify broadcast address
ifconfig en0 | grep broadcast | cut -d ' ' -f 6
# (b) Identify all IP adresses which are part of the same subnet
# ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. 
# When you try to ping an IP address on your local network, 
# say 192.168.1.1, your system has to turn the IP address 192.168.1.1 into a MAC address. 
# This involves using ARP to resolve the address, hence its name.
# subnet has a same 2 number in front of ip
arp -a | grep "10.13" | awk -F '[()]' '{print $2}'
